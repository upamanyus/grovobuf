= Translation of struct type

Go struct definition looks pretty similar to the .gb file

= Marshalling/unmarshalling

Marshalling struct:
  for all fields in struct:
     marshall_fieldType(s.fieldName)

For primitive types (ints, chars), will have marshall_{primitive}.

Marshalling slice:
  special case for []byte marshalling.
  marshall_sliceFooStruct(s []FooStruct) {
    marshall(len(s))
    for i in range s {
      marshall(f[i])
    }
  }

Marshalling map:
  marshall_fooBarMap (s map[foo]bar) {
    marshall(len(s))
    for k, v := range(s) {
      marshall_foo(k)
      marshall_bar(k)
    }
  }
